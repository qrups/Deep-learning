There are 2 deep learning projects:

1. Binary Semantic Segmentation:

   Goal: classify each image pixel as the foreground (object of interest) or the background.

   model: UNet, ResNet34

   Dataset: Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset

2. Diffusion model:

   Goal: implement a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate images according to multi-label conditions

   Tools: Hugging Face

p.s. This is a note of the assignments from the NYCU deep learning course
